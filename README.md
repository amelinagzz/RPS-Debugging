This starter project will help you learn more about how to use debugging tools in Xcode.

The project is a Rock Paper Scissors game. 

It has 3 screens:

Active Bugs:

- Crashes when selecting an answer
- Play again button not working as expected
- Game logic is wrong
- Titles in the view controllers don't show
