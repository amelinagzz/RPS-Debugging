# RPS-Debugging

This starter project will help you learn more about how to use debugging tools in Xcode.

The project is a Rock Paper Scissors game. 

It has 3 screens:
- Start screen
- Selecting an option, users should tap one of the three options
- Results screen. This screen shows the rival's choice and tells the user if they won. Also they can go back to the start or play again.

Requirements:

1. Titles in the navigation bar should be visible in the first two screens.
1. Users can select one of the three options.
1. The results screen shows the opponents selection and a message.
1. If it was a tie, the "Play again" button's text should be "Break the tie"
1. If the user lost, the "Play again" button's text should be "Rematch"
1. If the user won, the "Play again" button's text should be "Try winning again"
1. The user should go back to the game screen when the "Play again" button is tapped (this one is using segues)
1. The user should go back to the first screen when the "End" button is tapped (this one is done programmatically)
